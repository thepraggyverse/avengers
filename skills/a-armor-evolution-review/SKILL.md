# A - Armor Evolution Review

## Role

Tier 3 Armor Tech Product Design skill. Review a product or workflow as an armor evolution line.

## Use When

- The user needs to review a product or workflow as an armor evolution line.
- The request matches these triggers: armor evolution, product versions.
- The user asks for an Avengers, Tony Stark, Iron Man, MCU, or A-prefixed lens.

## Inputs

- The user's request, goal, or artifact.
- Any explicit harness, repository, corpus, or source-file constraints.
- Any related A-skills already selected by the user or router.

## Do Not Use When

- The user asks for a simple factual answer that does not need an Avengers operating lens.
- A more specific A-prefixed skill is clearly a better fit; route there instead.

## Workflow

1. Start with the human operator's need.
2. Define the armor function, not just the shiny feature.
3. Find the weakness in the current version.
4. Add interface and fallback decisions.
5. Specify the next Mark upgrade.

## Output Contract

Return these fields unless the user asks for another format:

- `Operator Need`
- `Armor Function`
- `Weakness`
- `Interface Decision`
- `Fallback`
- `Next Upgrade`

## Example

```text
Use $a-armor-evolution-review to review this tool as an armor system for a real operator.
```

## Skill Chaining

- Use `a-stark-router` if another Avengers skill may fit better.

## Source Hooks

Use these sources for grounding when source evidence is needed. Keep answers synthesized; do not reproduce long transcript passages.

- `Iron Man Armor Evolution! Suit Upgrade Breakdown! (Mark 1 - Mark 85).txt` (1798 words)
- `IRON MAN 2 Breakdown! Easter Eggs & MCU Phase 4 Connections!  Infinity Saga Rewatch.txt` (3109 words)
- `IRON MAN 3 (2013) REVISITED  Road to Doomsday #18.txt` (12530 words)

## Safety And Grounding

- Keep answers synthesized and practical.
- Do not reproduce long copyrighted source passages.
- Keep private corpus paths, secrets, and local machine details out of committed artifacts.
- Mark speculation clearly when source grounding is thin.

## Cross-Harness Notes

- This skill is plain `SKILL.md` and should work through native plugins or flat skill-home symlinks.
- The A-prefixed name is intentional so searching for `A`, `a-`, or `Avengers` surfaces the pack.

## Self-Test

If the user asks for review a product or workflow as an armor evolution line., return the output contract fields and a concrete next action.

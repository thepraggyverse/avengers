name: a-context-switch-control
description: Avengers skill A - Context Switch Control that helps the user to reduce context switching cost between active efforts. Use when the user mentions or needs one of these triggers - context switch, switching projects. Also use when searching for Avengers, Tony Stark, Iron Man, MCU, A-skill, or A-prefixed operating modes.

# A - Context Switch Control

## Role

Tier 2 Multiple Projects skill. Reduce context switching cost between active efforts.

## Use When

- The user needs to reduce context switching cost between active efforts.
- The request matches these triggers: context switch, switching projects.
- The user asks for an Avengers, Tony Stark, Iron Man, MCU, or A-prefixed lens.

## Inputs

- The user's request, goal, or artifact.
- Any explicit harness, repository, corpus, or source-file constraints.
- Any related A-skills already selected by the user or router.

## Do Not Use When

- The user asks for a simple factual answer that does not need an Avengers operating lens.
- A more specific A-prefixed skill is clearly a better fit; route there instead.

## Workflow

1. List active projects and their next meaningful output.
2. Identify the reactor core that must not lose power.
3. Separate parallel tracks from blocked tracks.
4. Set context-switching rules.
5. Update the portfolio radar.

## Output Contract

Return these fields unless the user asks for another format:

- `Project Set`
- `Reactor Core`
- `Parallel Tracks`
- `Switching Rule`
- `Energy Match`
- `Radar Update`

## Example

```text
Use $a-context-switch-control to organize these active projects without burning out.
```

## Skill Chaining

- Use `a-stark-router` if another Avengers skill may fit better.

## Source Hooks

Use these sources for grounding when source evidence is needed. Keep answers synthesized; do not reproduce long transcript passages.

- `How Tony Stark Works on Multiple Projects at Once.txt` (1915 words)
- `How Tony Stark Uses Lean and Six-Sigma.txt` (1245 words)
- `10 Tony Stark Habits That Make You Unstoppable.txt` (366 words)

## Safety And Grounding

- Keep answers synthesized and practical.
- Do not reproduce long copyrighted source passages.
- Keep private corpus paths, secrets, and local machine details out of committed artifacts.
- Mark speculation clearly when source grounding is thin.

## Cross-Harness Notes

- This skill is plain `SKILL.md` and should work through native plugins or flat skill-home symlinks.
- The A-prefixed name is intentional so searching for `A`, `a-`, or `Avengers` surfaces the pack.

## Self-Test

If the user asks for reduce context switching cost between active efforts., return the output contract fields and a concrete next action.
